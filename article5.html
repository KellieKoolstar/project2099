        <h1 class="title">Inside the latest AI music boycott</h1>
        <p>Date: Sep. 5, 2099</p>

    <p>In a world where artificial intelligence has revolutionized every aspect of human life—from healthcare to entertainment—one industry has found itself at the heart of a growing controversy: music. As AI music - considered either music created by humans using AI or music created by androids and humanoids - becomes more sophisticated and integrated into mainstream culture, a powerful backlash is sweeping through the music community, leading to another "AI music boycott".</p>
    <p>The boycott, which began earlier this year, has sparked widespread debate about the role of AI in creative industries, the value of human artistry, and what it means for the future of music. A coalition of top-tier human musicians, composers, and independent artists—along with thousands of fans—has taken a stand, refusing to promote, support, or engage with AI-generated music in any form. It's particularly interesting because 5 of the top 10 songs on the Billboard Top 10 were made by droid artists. Perhaps this boycott is born from human jealousy and anger at being pushed out of an industry they once dominated.</p>
    <p>In response to the boycott, many android artists such as Luna Novus, Vexa 7, and Cypher*Clas have protested the "unjust" boycott of music they believe is just as valid as human-made music. Luna Novus herself, having just finished the last leg of her <a href="article6.html" target="_blank"><i>Dimensions</i> tour</a> in Tokyo, remarked on social media that "it's ridiculous that ten years into [her] career, droids are still being discriminated against. The music industry is supposed to be inclusive, allowing anyone with any background or experience to express themselves. This boycott is disheartening to all the droids out there who work very hard at what they do."</p>
    <h3>The Rise of AI in Music</h3>
    <p>The parameters of the boycott are made even more complex as nowadays, it’s almost impossible to distinguish between a human and an AI-created piece. Algorithms have access to decades of music history, trends, and intricate patterns of human emotion, allowing them to create songs that resonate on a deeply personal level. AI can not only replicate the styles of legendary artists but innovate entirely new sounds and genres, with some AI-generated hits topping global charts.</p>
    <p>In recent years, AI-produced tracks have flooded streaming platforms, radio stations, and concert halls. Some of the top artists in the world are humanoids. Heck, even the <a href="article2.html" target="_blank"><i>president</i></a> might be an android. But while some listeners welcome the innovation, many musicians view AI music as an existential threat—displacing human creativity in favor of faster, cheaper, and more predictable outputs. For some, AI music represents an erosion of the very soul of the art form.</p>
    <h3>A New Divide: Human Artistry vs. Synthetic Sound</h3>
    <p>The boycott is largely led by the Human Creators Coalition, a global network of human artists who have vowed to withdraw from streaming platforms that feature AI-generated or android content. The coalition argues that AI's involvement in music has reduced the industry to a transactional, algorithmic process, one that prioritizes quantity and predictability over authenticity and emotional depth.</p>
    <p>Olivia Novak, a Grammy-winning composer and vocal advocate for the boycott, explains the coalition’s position: "Androids can replicate a sound, but they can’t replicate the lived experience behind it. The stories of heartbreak, joy, and struggle that define human music—those are being lost in a sea of identical, soulless androids that think they are sentient. Humans who use AI are also contributing to the problem. We’re fighting to preserve the essence of music, and that means standing against this onslaught of synthetic content."</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Vera Chen, a prominent electronic producer who once worked exclusively with AI to compose her albums, has been one of the boycott’s most vocal critics. "When I first started working with AI, I thought it would help me push creative boundaries. But over time, I realized the music was becoming more hollow. The surprise, the chaos, the imperfection—all of that was being lost in favor of more perfect, predictable patterns. It felt like the human touch was slipping away," she said.</p>
    <p>In the end, as the debate rages on, the question persists: Can AI and human creativity coexist, or will we look back in 50 years and remember the boycott as a crucial moment in the ongoing evolution of music?</p>
