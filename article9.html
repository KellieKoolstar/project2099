    <h1 class="title">'Chrono-Detectives' star Alissa Moran defends droid co-star Oliwier Robbins</h1>
    <p>Date: July 28, 2099</p>
    <p>By: A. Hurst, PR Correspondent</p>

    <div class="article-and-sidebar">
<article>
    <p>Earlier this month 'Chrono-Detectives' went viral on social media, not for its fun time-travel plot or innovative interactive experience, but for the scandal of its two main stars appearing together outside of set on numerous occasions. Paparazzi caught them outside a Cafe Du Monde in Neo-Metro just yesterday appearing to embrace and even kiss at one point.</p>
    <p>This isn't your ordinary scandal, however. While it is suspicious how soon star Alissa Moran found a new man after her high-profile breakup with Finnley Kade (a.k.a. half of the duo <a href="article4.html" target="_blank">Lysa 4.0</a>) just two months ago, what's even more surprising is that Alissa's new boyfriend <i>isn't even human</i>. Oliwier's casting in the film was quite controversial for being the first time a humanoid has portrayed a human in a film. (The second instance occurred very soon after, with the casting of Astra Nova in a lead role in <a href="article7.html" target="_blank">"Eclipse: The Last Starfall"</a>)</p>
    <p>Humanoids have notoriously been shunned in the past by both androids and humans for their status as being somewhere in between - not simple tools to help humans, but also not sentient equals. Most dating apps don't even allow humanoids to sign up, contributing to a culture of viewing and treating humanoids as "less-than".</p>
    <p>However, it seems actress Alissa Moran is looking to dispel the stereotypes and prejudice surrounding relationships with humanoids, whether she intended to or not. Because if Oliwier and Alissa were planning to make their relationship public, the paparazzi beat them to it.</p>

    <p>Online, many fans have passed judgement on both Alissa and Oliwier for their relationship, prompting Alissa to post this: "I don't know why everyone is so obsessed with my business. I know Oliwier is a humanoid, and I also know that he has a soul and that we share a very real emotional connection. I don't care that he's a humanoid, he's just as human as I am. Our relationship is better than any relationship I ever had with a human. We formed a genuine bond while filming Chrono-Detectives and it's an experience I will never forget. I hope you all watch our movie that we worked so hard on, and work through your prejudices instead of taking it out on us."</p>

    <p>Alissa's ex, Finnley Kade, even responded to toxic fans, posting a message of support for her new relationship: "alissa is and always will be a good friend of mine, and does not deserve the toxicity or disrespect she's being treated with. our split was mutual, and i only wish the best for her and oliwier. i met oliwier last year and i think he's a great person. just leave the couple alone and get a life!"</p>

    <p>Oliwier himself has yet to make a statement on the controversy, but has expressed in the past how he is very much an emotional and sentient being. Along with Astra Nova, another high-profile humanoid making waves in the industry this summer, Oliwier has had to reckon with a society and a culture that may not be ready to accept him yet. Regardless, it's clear that Alissa and his other castmates have embraced him and he seems to be doing just fine. The words of some haters on social media means nothing when you get to date Alissa Moran <i>and</i> get paid <i>$5 million</i> in only your second major film. Let's just hope the couple makes it past the press tour!</p>
