                after almost a century of AI and 50 years of AI androids.

                <h3>What are AI androids?</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2050, scientists were finally able to create perfect physical bodies to house AI systems. These seemingly human bodies with AI brains
                    were practically indistinguishable from actual humans. These AI
                    androids, later shortened to be simply called "droids", became ubiquitous in society, assisting doctors in surgery, teaching children in 
                    classrooms, serving people in restaurants, and even aiding politicians in the White House. Almost 50
                    years after their genesis, they've completely revolutionized humanity itself. But many are beginning to wonder: are they capable of actual humanity?
                </p>

                <h3>Can AI be truly sentient?</h3>
                <p>Many droids have begun taking to the streets to advocate for their rights. They build our homes, offices, restaurants, schools, and more, and have begun to protest
                    their low ranking on the social hierarchy of our society. They believe they should have equal rights and dignities to humans. 
                    But should they be granted equal privileges? Many androids proclaim they are sentient, while the majority of humans would refute these claims. Still,
                    as they are such an important part of our society, shouldn't we at least consider the possibility that androids may not want to be
                    our slaves?
                </p>

                <h3>How can you differentiate androids from humans?</h3>
                <p>
                    Typically, only extremely perceptive humans known as "Detectors" are able to tell just from a glance who is human and who is android. These people have
                    a few techniques, such as examining the eyes, nervous habits (androids tend to lack those), hands, scars on
                    the body, and for some, sensing a general presence of soul. Many Detectors worry they'll be out of a job if androids are allowed to fully integrate in human society. 
                    After all, who will hire you to differentiate humans and droids if they are considered one and the same?
