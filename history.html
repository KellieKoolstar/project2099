    <p><b>2045:</b> They created a physical form for AI that looked extremely realistic, eliminating the uncanny valley effect (aka AI androids, simply called androids). In order to differentiate androids from humans, a segregation system was created.</p>
    <p><b>2050:</b> humanoids are created. Celebrities and wealthy people begin to implant their consciousness into an android body so that they can live on as a humanoid even as their human body dies.</p>
    <p><b>2056:</b> Androids and humanoids (all together referred to as droids) start fighting for equal rights, believing they are sentient</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Droids rebel against the segregation system, begin to infiltrate everywhere</li>
        <li>When it is found out the US president is an android, the US goes into a civil war</li>
        <li>Countries around the world have similar wars, leading to a world war</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>2063:</b> World War 3 officially starts</p>
    <p><b>2072:</b> A treaty is drawn up; humans and droids will co-exist in equality. It was agreed no more androids or humanoids would be made (this agreement has since been broken many times). Androids controlled the government, making it easier to accomplish their goals. Following 2072 was a period of relative peace, as the world rebuilt and recovered.</p>
    <p><b>2097:</b> Civil unrest amongst humans who are upset androids never die, and thus are able to build empires that they never relinquish; meanwhile more and more humans are living in poverty.</p>
    <p><b>2099:</b> Growing fears mount that androids plan to enslave humans. They monitor humansâ€™ every move and thought through their technology. Androids are still not allowed in the highest positions of government, but many are speculating the US president is an android or humanoid in disguise. As of now, the future is very uncertain.</p>
