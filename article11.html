    <h1 class="title">Synthia X reflects on her past on new album 'Hypernova'</h1>

    <p>In an era where the lines between humanity and technology continue to blur, Synthia X is a name that stands as both a symbol of the future and a reflection of the present. The 25-year-old musician, whose soulful synth-pop anthems have dominated the airwaves for the past few years, is no stranger to the complexities of identity. Raised by a human father and a humanoid mother, Synthia's life has been a constant balancing act between two worlds—one that seeks to define her and another that constantly tries to place her in a box. With her new album, 'Hypernova', she opens up like never before, blending the personal with the universal in a strikingly raw collection of songs that explore the themes of self-discovery, heartbreak, and the struggle for belonging.</p>
    <p>We sat down with Synthia to talk about Hypernova, the challenges of living in 2099 as a "mixed" person in a divided society, and the journey of finding herself in a world that’s anything but simple.</p>

    <h2>'Hypernova': A Reflection on the Past and a Leap Into the Future</h2>
    <p><b>Maya Cortes:</b> Synthia, 'Hypernova' has been getting a lot of attention for its deeply personal themes. What was the inspiration behind the album, and how does it reflect where you are in life right now?</p>
    <p><b>Synthia X:</b> I think 'Hypernova' is very much a reflection of my journey over the past few years. It’s an album about feeling both fractured and whole at the same time, about coming to terms with parts of myself I didn’t want to face. I’ve always been in between—between human and humanoid, between two different worlds. But this time around, I really wanted to explore what it means to be me, not just the label of "humanoid" or "human."</p>
    <p>A lot of it is about reckoning with my past. There are songs on the album that touch on the childhood memories of growing up with my human father and humanoid mother. My parents faced a lot of rejection and scrutiny simply for loving each other, and as I grew up I realized the true extent of the hate we experienced as a family. I think a lot of people don’t realize how difficult that was. At home, it was just love, but outside, it was like I was from two completely different worlds. I grew up with this deep yearning to truly fit in society, and I think that tension is woven into every song on 'Hypernova'.</p>

    <p><b>Maya Cortes: </b>Your upbringing certainly must have shaped your music, especially with the divided landscape of 2099. Humans and androids, though living side by side, are still at odds in many ways. Do you feel like you're still caught in the middle of this divide?</p>
    <p><b>Synthia X: </b>Absolutely. I think anyone who is "mixed" in this world feels that. There’s always a part of you that’s being pulled in two directions. You can’t fully embrace either side without being questioned or doubted. I’m often seen as a human, but when people know who my mother is—an android—it’s like they look at me differently. It’s hard to explain, but there’s a certain kind of... rejection you face from both sides. Humans still view androids as tools, as "other," and androids see humans as flawed, limited in ways they don’t want to be. So where does that leave someone like me?</p>
    <p>It’s exhausting, honestly. But that’s why music has been my escape. It’s a space where I can be completely myself, unfiltered. When I sing, there are no labels—just me and my experiences. I don’t have to explain my identity to the audience. They can just feel it.</p>

    <h2>Heartbreak and Healing</h2>
    <p><b>Maya Cortes: </b>On top of the challenges of identity, Hypernova also seems to reflect a period of personal struggle, particularly around a recent breakup. Can you talk a little about that?</p>
    <p><b>Synthia X:</b> Yeah. The breakup with my ex was definitely a tough chapter in my life, and I think it’s one of the main emotional threads in this album. I don’t want to get too deep into the details, but when you love someone and they’re a part of your world, and then suddenly they’re not, it leaves a hole in you. It took me a while to get over it, to find peace with myself again. But I think that’s what Hypernova is: a story of healing, of reclaiming myself after I felt lost.</p>
    <p><b>Maya Cortes:</b> I think it's really nice you can express yourself as such. However, I do have to address the elephant in the room!</p>
    <p><b>Synthia X:</b> (laughs) Oh gosh, you're really gonna ask?</p>
    <p><b>Maya Cortes: </b>You don't have to answer, I just think your fans - and Finnley Kade's fans - would love a clear confirmation or denial of the rumors. I mean, what's up with those Paris photos? You two looked awfully close.</p>
    <p><b>Synthia X: </b>I was in Paris for Lysa's birthday, we've actually been friends since we were 17. I met Finnley for the first time, which is crazy because Lysa and him have been working together for so long. Anyways, it was very lovely to meet him and we got along really well. We're both dealing with rather recent breakups, so neither of us is about to rush into something. But you know what? I do think there's potential for us. That's all I'm gonna say.</p>

    <h2>The Future of Synthia X: What's Next?</h2>
    <p><b>Maya Cortes: </b>So, after everything you’ve gone through, where do you see yourself going next? What’s on the horizon for you, both as an artist and a person?</p>
    <p><b>Synthia X: </b>Honestly, I don’t know. I’m just taking things one day at a time. I think that’s what this album taught me: it’s okay not to have all the answers. It’s okay to not know exactly who you are or where you’re going. The important thing is that you keep moving forward.</p>
    <p>I’m excited for the next chapter, whatever that may be. I’ve already started working on new material, but right now, I’m focused on living in the moment and seeing where it takes me. I think, at the end of the day, the only thing I can really control is my own truth. I’ll keep making music that feels real, that speaks to who I am right now, and maybe along the way, I’ll find some of those answers I’m looking for. But for now, I’m just grateful for the journey.</p>
